#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you’re asking for will touch the following files in your repository:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – to update the `title` and `description` values that the app uses everywhere.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – to create a new image file that will become the app’s logo.  

These two files are the only ones that need to be edited to generate a new logo and update the app’s metadata. Once you add them to the chat, I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A simple logo featuring the app's name in bold, modern typography against a clean background. The logo should have a minimalistic design with a subtle gradient and a small symbol representing knowledge or explanation, placed to the left of the text. The background should be a light neutral color, and the text should be dark for contrast.
